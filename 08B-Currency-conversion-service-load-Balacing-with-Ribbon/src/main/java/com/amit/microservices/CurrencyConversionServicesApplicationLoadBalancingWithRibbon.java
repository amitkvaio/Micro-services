Types of Load Balancing:
************************
There are two types of load balancing

Server Side Load Balancing: 
	Server side load balancing is a monolithic It applies between the client and the server. 
Client-Side Load Balancing: 
	The client holds the list of serverâ€™s IPs so that it can deliver the requests. 
	The client selects an IP from the list, randomly, and forwards the request to the server.


Netflix Ribbon

</dependency>
*******************

Netflix Ribbon is a Part of Netflix Open Source Software (Netflix OSS). 
	It is a cloud library that provides the client-side load balancing. 
	It automatically interacts with Netflix Service Discovery (Eureka) because it is a member of the Netflix family.


The Ribbon mainly provides client-side load balancing algorithms. 
	It is a client-side load balancer that provides control over the behavior of HTTP and TCP client. 
	The important point is that when we use Feign, the Ribbon also applies.
