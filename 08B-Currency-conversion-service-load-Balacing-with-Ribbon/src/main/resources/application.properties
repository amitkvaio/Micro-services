#URL access
#Currency Exchange Service
#http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

#Currency Conversion Service

#How to run this application(IMPORTANT)
#*****************************************
#First run 06-Currency-exchange-service-configure-jpa with three instance with port number 8000, 8001,8002
#Start this application and check the above url
#http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
#	Is the rest template call port number is hard coded so refreshing the url port will not change
#http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
#	is the feign client and with ribbon load balance refresh this url you will see the port number is changing.
# 	However we are able to achieve the load balance but here we are hard-coding the port number
# 	Think about what happen if we have n numbers of instance, its difficult to write that number of port
#	we can do better by using the Eureka naming server.
